# The mainstream Usecases in the ML world are simplified here. These are someof the fundamental examples, I have given required theory to the problem statement and provided code as solution !!

**You will see...**

**The RealTime Chatbot Agent Implementation**

**Customer Recommendation Engines**

**Customer Churn**

**Dynamic Pricing**

**Fraud Detection**

**Classification and Image Recognition**

**So on... **
